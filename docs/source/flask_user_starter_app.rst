Flask-User-starter-app
======================

While the single-file QuickStart app provides a quick way to illustrate the use of Flask-User,
we do not recommend its single-file techniques.

The Flask-User-starter-app follows typical Flask application practices using multiple files
in an organized directory structure::

    app/
        commands/
        models/
        static/
        templates/
        views/
    tests/

This may serve as a great starting place to create your next Flask application.
