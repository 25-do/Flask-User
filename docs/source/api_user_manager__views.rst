UserManager View methods
========================

Below is a complete list of customizable Flask-User views.

.. note::

    These methods are part of the ``UserManager`` class.
    The docs show it under the `UserManager__View` mixin class
    that we use to modulerize ``UserManager`` class code across several code files.

Note: Customization happens on the ``UserManager`` class.
The `UserManager__Views` class is mixed into the `UserManager` class,
allowing us to split the code and docs across several files.
